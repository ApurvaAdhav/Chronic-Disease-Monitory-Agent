# Chronic-Disease-Monitory-Agent
An AI-powered system for real-time monitoring and risk prediction of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and heart conditions. The project leverages wearable sensor data, machine learning, and cloud deployment to provide timely alerts and health insights.

# Problem Statement
Chronic diseases require continuous monitoring, but existing systems rely on periodic checkups, leading to delays in intervention. There's a need for an intelligent solution that offers real-time analysis and alerts.

# Technologies Used
Platform: IBM watsonx.ai, IBM Cloud Object Storage
Tools: IBM Watson Studio, Cloud Functions

# Result
The system achieved high accuracy in classifying patient health status using real-time sensor data. It effectively generated instant alerts for abnormal conditions, enabling early intervention. The integration with IBM watsonx.ai ensured scalable and reliable deployment. Overall, the solution demonstrated strong potential for improving chronic disease management through continuous monitoring and AI-driven risk prediction.
